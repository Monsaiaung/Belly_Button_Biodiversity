# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview of the project

The purpose of the project is to create a visualization of bacterial data and informations for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Deliverables

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
